YOUHOLE FEATURE LIST:

- Buffering (Two IFrames)
- Responsive button (animates on click & disappears / reappears based on mouse movement)
- Keyboard controls
- Better foreign language support (e.g., using dictionaries rather than nonsense phrases or using Google Translate)
- Mobile / Non-Chrome support (use v2 API)

Notes:

I removed "All successful video IDs are stored and blacklisted" from the list b/c I don't think it's actually necessary. I've never gotten the same video twice, and if I did I think it would indicate the random seed algorithims weren't robust enough.
